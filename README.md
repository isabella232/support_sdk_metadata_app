# SDK Metadata App

The **SDK Metadata App** is a Zendesk ticket app that allows you to see information relating to a ticket if it was created via the [Support SDK](https://developer.zendesk.com/embeddables).

### The following information is displayed about the end-user:

* Device name
* Operating system and version
* Whether the user was logged in (JWT authentication) or not (anonymous authentication)
* Battery level
* Device storage
* Device memory
* IP address
* Location (on a Google map)
* Location (as a string)
* Weather in that area
* Version of the Support SDK that is in use.

Please submit bug reports to this repo as issues. Pull requests are welcome.
